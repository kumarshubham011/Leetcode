# Traverse linked list using two pointers.
# Move one pointer(slow_p) by one and another pointer(fast_p) by two.
# If these pointers meet at the same node then there is a loop. If pointers do not meet then linked list doesnâ€™t have a loop.

# But our focus is on where the cycle has started. So, for that once they meet [slow == fast] then, we will reset the slow back to head & start moving slow with 1X speed and fast will carry on from where it was previously but with 1X speed
